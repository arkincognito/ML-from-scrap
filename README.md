# ML-from-scrap

 This group of ipnyb files are my MLP codings without(or mostly without) any machine learning modules such as pytorch, scikit(other than utilizing the datasets), etc...
 It was my first ML codings to test my understanding of the basic ML process, so I built the codes from scratch, using numpy.
 So...If you wonder why I used something faster and simpler that others have already created, it was just for my practice, nothing more.
