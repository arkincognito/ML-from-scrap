# ML-from-scrap

 This group of ipnyb files are my MLP codings without(or mostly without) prebuilt machine learning libraries such as pytorch, scikit(other than utilizing the datasets), etc...
 
 If you wonder why I didn't use those elegant faster, and easier to use libraries that others have already created, I just wanted to see if I understood how these basic ML parts work. So I tried avoiding libraries built for ML, and made my own functions from numpy.
